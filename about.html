  <div class="sidetext"><P> Hi I'm the proud owner of a 2007 Jeep Wrangler. Ever since I purchased this beauty back in 2013 it has been a constant drain on my bank account. When I purchased this item it was as if it came directly from the factory. and as you can see it looks nothing like a stock jeep wrangler. I need help! I'll post a link to a go fund me page later on!
