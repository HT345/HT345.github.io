Steps
Cheesy lentil pies

Preheat oven to hot, 200Â°C. Lightly grease 8 recesses of a texas muffin pan.
Heat oil in a large frying pan on high. Saute onion, carrot, capsicum and garlic for 2-3 minutes, until onion is tender.
Stir in spices and cook for 1 minute, until fragrant. Mix in tomatoes and simmer for 4-5 minutes, until thickened slightly. Blend in lentils and cook, stirring, for 1-2 minutes, until heated through. Cool slightly.
Cut each piece of pastry into quarters. Ease into prepared recesses. Prick bases and bake for 8-10 minutes. Cool slightly.
Spoon filling evenly between pastry cases. Sprinkle with cheese. Bake for 10-15 minutes, until golden. Serve with yoghurt (or tzatziki, if preferred) and salad.
